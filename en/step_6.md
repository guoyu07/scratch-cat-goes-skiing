## Random obstacle

The obstacle always appears in the same place on the screen, to make the game challenging the obstacles should appeared in a different position every time.

+ Make a variable called `obstacle_x`{:class="blockdata"}.

[[[generic-scratch-add-variable]]]

+ At the start of the `forever loop`{:class="blockcontrol"}, `set obstacle_x`{:class="blockdata"} to a `random number`{:class="blockoperators"}
