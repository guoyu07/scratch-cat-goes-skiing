## Adding a score

Each time the skier sprite makes it past an obstacle, they should earn points.

+ `Make a variable`{:class="blockdata"} called `score`{:class="blockdata"} and set it to zero at the start of the game.

+ Change the code so that when the sprite gets past the obstacle, it `changes score by 1`{:class="blockdata"}.

The updated script for the sprite should look like this:
