[[[generic-scratch-draw-sprite]]]

If you are short on time you can [download](resources/skiing_cat.sprite2) this pre-made sprite and add it into your project.

[[[generic-scratch-add-sprite-from-file]]]

+ Paint a new backdrop for your ski slope, fill the background grey and add some straight lines

![ski slope backdrop](images/backdrop.png)

+ Add the code to your skier sprite so it appears at the top of the slope and points downhill when the flag is pressed.

+ Select the 'Scripts' tab and have a look at the `Events`{:class="blockevents"} and `Motion`{:class="blockmotion"} blocks.

--- /hint ---

--- hint ---

+ When the `green flag is clicked`{:class="blockevents"}, make your skier sprite `go to the x & y`{:class="blockmotion"} co-ordinates at the top of the screen and `point in the direction`{:class="blockmotion"} of 90 degrees.

This is what your code should look like:

```blocks
	when green flag clicked
	go to x: (0) y: (100)
	point in direction (90 v)
```

+ Test and save your project.
